//1. List the five falsey values in JavaScript.

//2. List five truthy values in JavaScript.

//3.Take a look at the code example below and state what the variable sameAge will be set to and explain why.
var myAge = 33;
var yourAge = "33";

var sameAge = (myAge === yourAge) ? "Yes!" : "No!";

//answer: it would be set too the string "no!" because myAge is a number and yourAge is a string so they can not be striclly equal

//4.Write a small program that has a line of code that does each of the following and prints out the result:

//Add two numbers together.
//EG: eight plus fifteen
var num1 = 8;
var num2 = 15;

var sum = num1 + num2;

console.log(sum);

//Add three numbers together using the addition operator.
//EG: eight plus fifteen plus negative one hundred
var num1 = 8;
var num2 = 9;
var num3 = 10;

var sum = num1 + num2 + num3;

console.log(sum);

//Add a positive and a negative number.
//EG: negative five plus thirty two point eight
var num1 = -8;
var num2 = 8;

var sum = num1 + num2;

console.log(sum);

//Subtract two numbers.
//EG: thirty five minus two point eight
var num1 = 8;
var num2 = 7;

var diff = num1 - num2;

console.log(diff);

//Subtract three numbers.
//EG: thirty five minus two point eight minus seventeen
var num1 = 8;
var num2 = 9;
var num3 = 10;

var diff = num1 - num2 - num3;

console.log(diff);

//Subtract a positive and a negative number.
//EG: negative five plus thirty two minus eight
var num1 = 8;
var num2 = -8;

var diff = num1 - num2;

console.log(diff);

//Combine the addition and subtraction operators with three numbers.
//EG: seventy five plus negative thirty five minus two point eight
var num1 = 8;
var num2 = 9;
var num3 = 10;

var sumdiff = num1 - num2 + num3;

console.log(sumdiff);

//Multiply two numbers
//EG: six times negative zero point one
var num1 = 8;
var num2 = 9;

var multi = num1 * num2;

console.log(multi);

//Multiply three numbers where one is negative
//EG: negative eight times five times one billion point eight
var num1 = 8;
var num2 = -8;
var num3 = 9;

var multi = num1 * num2 * num3;

console.log(multi);

//Divide two numbers
//EG: five divided by negative twelve.
var num1 = 8;
var num2 = 16;

var divid = num1 / num2;

console.log(divid);

//Divide three numbers
//EG: twenty five divided by negative twelve divided by two
var num1 = 8;
var num2 = 16;
var num3 = 4;

var divid = num1 / num2 / num3;

console.log(divid);

//Find the remainder of dividing two integers
// EG: The remainder left when dividing twenty five by four
var num1 = 8;
var num2 = 17;

var mod = num1 % num2;

console.log(mod);


// An expression that uses each of the following: Negative and Positive Numbers, Integers and Doubles, Parenthesis, Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division, and Modulo.
// EG: The remainder of five plus negative four minus negative four times three divided by two point three, divided by nine

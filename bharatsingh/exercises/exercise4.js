// 4. Write a small program that has a line of code that does each of the following and prints out the result:

// Add two numbers together.
// EG: eight plus fifteen
console.log (8 + 15);

// Add three numbers together using the addition operator.
// EG: eight plus fifteen plus negative one hundred
console.log (8 + 15 + -100);

// Add a positive and a negative number.
// EG: negative five plus thirty two point eight
console.log(-5 + 32.8);

// Subtract two numbers.
// EG: thirty five minus two point eight
console.log(35 - 2.8);

// Subtract three numbers.
// EG: thirty five minus two point eight minus seventeen
console.log(35 - 2.8 - 17);

// Subtract a positive and a negative number.
// EG: negative five plus thirty two minus eight
console.log(-5 + 32 - 8);

// Combine the addition and subtraction operators with three numbers.
// EG: seventy five plus negative thirty five minus two point eight
console.log(75 + -35 - 2.8);

// // Multiply two numbers
// EG: six times negative zero point one
console.log(6 * -0.1);

// Multiply three numbers where one is negative
// EG: negative eight times five times one billion point eight
console.log(-8 * 5 * 1000000000.8)

// Divide two numbers
// EG: five divided by negative twelve.
console.log(5 / -12);

// Divide three numbers
// EG: twenty five divided by negative twelve divided by two
console.log(25 / -12 / 2);

// Find the remainder of dividing two integers
// EG: The remainder left when dividing twenty five by four
console.log(25 % 4);

An expression that uses each of the following: Negative and Positive Numbers, Integers and Doubles, Parenthesis, Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division, and Modulo.
EG: The remainder of five plus negative four minus negative four times three divided by two point three, divided by nine
console.log(
	(5 + (-4) - (-4) * 3 / 2.3) % 9
);

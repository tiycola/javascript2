1. Select the string expressions from the listed options.

    a. "Hello World"
    b. "Your number is " + someNumber
    c. "Hello" + "World"

2. Select all the falsey values from the following options:
    a. false
    b. 0
    c. ""
    e. null

3. Define the term "strict equality".
	Strict equality refers to the '===' operator. If the '===' is used, then the values that are being compared are true if they are exactly alike. '5' === 5 would be false because '5' is a string of the number 5 and the other is just the number 5. With the equality operator, '==', however, '5' == 5 would evaluate to true. 

4. What does ((42 - 8) + 24 / 6 - 3 * 0) * (34 + (7 + (4 + 3) % 3) / 2) evaluate to? Please evaluate this by hand.
    a. 1444
  
5. Which of the following operators do I use to invert a logical expression?
